			<p>As a freelance graphic designer from the Metro-Detroit area, she is known for her clean, creative designs, attention to detail, and quick turn-around. She has 10 years of design experience working with a wide-range of clients including the automotive industry, retail stores, interior designers, public relations and marketing firms, human resources consultants, realtors, and even a psychic! Some of the more well-known brands she's worked with include <a href="https://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/index" target="_blank">Mercedes-Benz</a>, <a href="https://www.bmwusa.com/" target="_blank">BMW</a>, <a href="https://www.napaonline.com/" target="_blank">NAPA Auto Parts</a>, <a href="https://www.ngksparkplugs.com/" target="_blank">NGK Spark Plugs</a> and <a href="http://www.magna.com" target="_blank">Magna International</a>.</p>

			<p>In addition to her Graphic Design Diploma from Specs Howard School of Media Arts (where she was awarded the Achievement, Commitment and Excellence award by the instructors) she holds a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Administration from Central Michigan University and a Master's of Science Degree in Management from Walsh College of Accountancy and Business. She graduated with honors from all of her programs. She has over 25 years of corporate experience. Her business background gives her a high-level of professionalism.</p>

			<p>When she's not creating designs that help companies get their messages across in a visually-pleasing way, you can find her:</p>

					<li>crafting</li>
					<li>painting furniture</li>
					<li>tap- or ballet-dancing</li>
					<li class="last_li">playing Barbies with her daughter</li>
				</ol>

			<p>Andrea hopes to one day fulfill her dream of making the world a more beautiful place, one pixel at a time.</p>
